# GIT and GITHUB

<h2>Here the common command to be used are :</h2>
<h3>Git add :</h3>
        Git add is used to add the modified file for commit. Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.
        This gives us the raw picture of the things that are going to be committing on the official history.
<h3> Git branch: </h3>
                One of the best feature that the git provide us to branch
                which means we can practice different different code under different branch and the parent code will be same,
                and then we can switch to any of the branch and then we can merge it too.
                <ol>
                <li>This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool.</li> 
                <li>It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.</li>
                </ol>

<h3>Git checkout :</h3> 
                <ol>
                <li>git checkout command is used to switch between the branch and it is also used to create the branch.</li>
                <li>In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches.</li>
                <li>Combined with the basic Git commands, itâ€™s a way to work on a particular line of development.</li>
                 <ul><li>git checkout = To check the number of branches that we have in that file</li>
                <li>git checkout -b saurav = To create a new branch in that file</li>
                <li>git checkout saurav = To switch into the branch</li>
                <li>git checkout main< = To return back to the main branch/li>       
                </ul>
                </ol>
<h3>Git clean :</h3>  
                <ol>
                <li>  It removes the untracked files from the working directory </li>
                <li> This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.</li>
                </ol>
