## GitHub Actions

 GitHub provides a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform called GitHub Actions. It allows automated testing and deployment workflows.

## Integration

 GitHub integrates with various third-party tools and services, making it a hub for software development. This includes integrations with popular code editors, project management tools, and more.

## Security

GitHub offers security features like code scanning, dependency analysis, and vulnerability alerts to help maintain code quality and security.

In summary, Git is a version control system that tracks changes in source code, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting and collaboration tools for Git repositories.
